### Pooling System
Created a generic pooling system that can be expanded and is dynamic.

### Find Nearest Neighbour
Created a custom system using jobs to calculate the nearest object off all objects that has a NeighborComponent and draw a line between the nearest objects.

### Draw Line Between Objects
The nearest neighbor system calculates the near objects and draw lines between them.

### Random Movement
This was a really simple system where I can define the maximum range that the object can spawn and move. The range and speed can be changed on the scriptable object.

### Scriptable Objects
Settings can be changed on scriptable objects in the GameSettings folder, Inputs, update interval, movement range and speed, initial pooling size, etc...
